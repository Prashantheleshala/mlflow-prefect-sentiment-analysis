# Sentiment Analysis with MLflow

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility in sentiment analysis tasks. 
By integrating MLflow into our machine learning pipeline, we can efficiently log relevant information, track model performance, and manage our models effectively.

## Features
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow allows us to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts, enabling us to track experiments and reproduce results easily.
- **Model Management**: With MLflow, we can register and manage our trained models, making it simpler to deploy and monitor them in production.
- **Reproducibility**: By logging all the relevant information using MLflow tracking APIs, we ensure reproducibility across different experiments and environments.
- **Visualization**: MLflow provides built-in capabilities for visualizing metrics and hyperparameters, such as parallel coordinates charts and hyperparameter plots.

## Usage
1. **Training Models**: Train machine learning models while logging relevant information with MLflow.
2. **Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow tracking APIs.
3. **Customizing MLflow UI**: Customize MLflow UI with run names to enhance readability and organization.
4. **Visualization**: Analyze trends, identify optimal hyperparameters, and fine-tune models using metric plots and hyperparameter plots.
5. **Model Registration**: Register trained models with MLflow and manage them by tagging for easy retrieval and deployment.

INSTALLATION OF ML FLOW:
- In cmd pip install mlflow
- to open :  mlflow ui
